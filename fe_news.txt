DTA5 Client Update 2017-08-22:

The terminal client is released! It is mostly functional.

Two important features it still lacks:
  * command history
  * custom color settings

I would also like to eventually implement arbitrary
user-defined color highlights, but that's a major project
for the future.


Hints for using the client:

  * Backspace and Delete both work properly.
  * Left/Right Arrow Keys will move the insertion point.
  * Home/End keys will jump the insertion point to the
    beginning/end of the current input.
  * PgUp/PgDn will scroll the game window history one
    screenful (less a couple of lines) at a time.
  * F12 will immediately scroll the game window all the
    way down to the most current text.

Type HELP VERB for a list of verbs the game understands.
